- **Manual AI Integration**: Copy prompts to use with your preferred AI provider

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Install the extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. Ensure you have at least one AI extension installed (Amazon Q, Copilot, Cursor AI, or ChatGPT)
3. For missing AI extensions, follow the provided installation guidance within the extension

## üìñ Usage

### Quick Start
1. **Select Change Type**: Choose between commit, branch, or local changes
2. **Configure Options**: Set comparison targets (commit hash, branch name, etc.)
3. **Choose AI Provider**: Select from your installed AI extensions
4. **Trigger Review**: Start the review process
5. **Review Results**: Navigate through issues in the sidebar or inline annotations

### Available Commands
- **`AI Code Review: Local Changes`** - Review uncommitted changes using git diff
- **`AI Code Review: All Files`** - Scan all files in the repository
- **`AI Code Review: Compare Branches`** - Compare changes between two branches
- **`AI Code Review: Check Code Review Result`** - Check and process AI review results
- **`AI Code Review: Open Prompt File`** - Open the generated prompt file
- **`AI Code Review: Open Change File`** - Open the change detection file
- **`AI Code Review: Open Settings`** - Open extension settings
- **`AI Code Review: Paste Prompt to AI Chat`** - Paste the generated prompt to AI chat

### üîÑ Automatic Result Processing

The extension includes an intelligent file watcher that automatically monitors the `.ai-code-review/results` directory for new AI review result files:

- **Automatic Detection**: When you save an AI response as a JSON file in `.ai-code-review/results/`, the extension automatically detects it
- **Instant Processing**: The `checkReviewResult` command is triggered automatically without manual intervention
- **Real-time Updates**: UI components (Issues Panel, Inline Annotations, Review History) are updated immediately
- **User Notification**: You'll receive a notification with an option to view the processed results
- **Background Operation**: The file watcher runs continuously while the extension is active

#### How It Works
1. Generate a code review prompt using any of the available commands
2. Copy the prompt to your preferred AI provider (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
3. Save the AI's JSON response to `.ai-code-review/results/your-result.json`
4. The extension automatically detects the new file and processes it
5. Review results appear instantly in the VS Code interface

### Change Type Examples

#### Commit Review
- Select "Commit Changes" type
- Enter commit hash or use smart defaults (last commit, parent commit)
- Choose AI provider and start review

#### Branch Comparison
- Select "Branch Changes" type
- Choose source and target branches
- Configure additional options as needed

#### Local Changes
- Select "Local Changes" type
- Review uncommitted modifications
- Get instant feedback on your current work

### File Management & Cleanup

#### Smart Cleanup Behavior
The extension automatically manages temporary files in the `.ai-code-review` directory:

- **Selective Cleanup**: When generating new review files, only cleans specific folders (`prompts/`, `changes/`, `results/`) to make room for new content
- **Complete Cleanup**: When the extension is deactivated, the entire `.ai-code-review` directory is removed to keep your workspace clean
- **Preservation**: Files in other subdirectories are preserved during selective cleanup operations

#### Manual Cleanup
You can manually clean up review files by:
1. Restarting the extension (triggers selective cleanup)
2. Disabling and re-enabling the extension (triggers complete cleanup)
3. Deleting the `.ai-code-review` folder manually

### Review History Management

#### Accessing Review History
1. **Activity Bar Icon**: Click the AI Code Review icon in the VS Code activity bar
2. **Review History Panel**: Navigate to the "Review History" tab within the AI Code Review container
3. **View All Reviews**: See a chronological list of all completed code reviews

#### Review Result Management
- **Automatic Detection**: Scans for AI review result files in the workspace
- **Structured Parsing**: Processes AI responses into organized issue lists
- **Issue Classification**: Categorizes issues by type, severity, and location
- **File Navigation**: Direct links to problematic code with line-level precision
- **Result Storage**: Saves processed results in `.ai-code-review/results/` directory
